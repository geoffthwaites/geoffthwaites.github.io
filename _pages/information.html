  <h1>Information</h1>
  <p>Geoff Thwaites is a glass artist based in Cambridge, England.  He is an elected Fellow of the Guild of Glass Engravers, one of only 25 people who currently have this status. <p>Much of his work is done to commission, engraving either on commercial or specially made glass on a scale from goblets, tankards and decanters to doors and windows. Commissions often include lettering but may also incorporate illustrative elements. Colour can be included on flat glass using a collage technique. <p>In addition, he exhibits widely. For his exhibition pieces, he usually kiln-forms his own glass blanks and uses engraving, deep cutting and carving to create sculptural works.</p>
